        <p>
          I'm a open source oriented developer, i tend to whatever i do think
          about others first and think if anything that can be done can be open
          sourced. SInce the beginning this made me grow so much! I was capable
          of learning best practices in all scenarios, new tools, new ways of
          coding! Everything! The way that a product and a project should grow
          is end user first!
        </p>
        <p>
          When we developers are building something should be thinking how the
          end user will use it, and ship it as fast as possible! We need better
          tools and better development approach to be capable of tieing those
          two things together, which is what i'm always doing: tie high
          maintainability with customer experience and how we can aggregate
          value to the end user! And of course, i'm always worried with too much
          abstractions and too little, because either can be a problem! Anyone
          can expect from me simplicity, i'll always start from the simplest
          solution first, than iterate over and figure out what is the best!
